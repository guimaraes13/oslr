/*
 * Online Structure Learner by Revision (OSLR) is an online relational
 * learning algorithm that can handle continuous, open-ended
 * streams of relational examples as they arrive. We employ
 * techniques from theory revision to take advantage of the already
 * acquired knowledge as a starting point, find where it should be
 * modified to cope with the new examples, and automatically update it.
 * We rely on the Hoeffding's bound statistical theory to decide if the
 * model must in fact be updated accordingly to the new examples.
 * The system is built upon ProPPR statistical relational language to
 * describe the induced models, aiming at contemplating the uncertainty
 * inherent to real data.
